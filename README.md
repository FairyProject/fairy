# Fairy Framework
Fairy is a compat &amp; open-sourced Java Framework made with ♥. Fairy is heavily inspired from Spring Boot. 
Its objective is to bring the beauty of dependency injection and CRUD based design patterns to various platforms, including Minecraft server with platforms like Bukkit api, Bungee api etc. This project is a universal framework.

Main Maintainer: Imanity Software

### Advantage using Fairy Framework
Fairy as a universal framework, it mainly built for minecraft server plugins in mind. It's easily the best framework for minecraft server open sourced due to it flexibility, dependency injection pattern, and powerful backing system. 

With the flexibility Fairy had, we also have various platform supported that aren't minecraft related. [Application platform](https://github.com/FairyProject/fairy/tree/v5/io.fairyproject.platforms/app-platform) for independent platform, [Discord module]() built on top of JDA for better experience etc.

## Project State
We are currently staying at **`0.5.1`**, the reason why we still have 0 as the major version prefix is because we thought there is missing pieces before we can start with version 1.
Does not mean it's unusable.

## Objective
The objective of the project will be a fully `cross-platform` capable framework for minecraft. 
Where you can write code once and use on every platform with any version.
To achieve this it's nearly impossible for a single person or a small team, that's why this is open-sourced, if you can contribute the project we would be very appreciated!
