/**

 * Some things to note: commit() and rollback() also call close() on the
 * connection, so this class cannot be reused after the transaction is committed
 * or rolled back.

 * This is just a convenience class. If the implementation is too restrictive,
 * then you can manage your own transactions by calling Database.getConnection()
 * and operate on the Connection directly.
